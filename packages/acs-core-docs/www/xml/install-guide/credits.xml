    <para>Long before Bryan Quinn had anything to do with this guide, Adam
    Farkas and Brian Stein conceived of the idea. Working with Bryan Quinn
    for the first version were Doug Hoffman, Ravi Jasuja, Hiro Iwashima, Ryan
    Lee, and Jonathan Goler. Many ArsDigita employees contributed
    documentation, criticized the document, and tested every line. Among them
    were Audrey Mcloghlin, Doug Harris, Zvi Boshernitzan, Michael Yoon, Cesar
    Brea, Dennis Gregorovic, David Fullagar, and Chris Spears.</para>

    <para>A few members of the photo.net community were brave enough to test the
    documentation while it was still under development and contributed very
    valuable suggestions and bug reports. Among them were Kevin Tupper,
    Michael Duffy, Simon Carstensen, and Dave Bauer.</para>

    <para>This document was assembled in part from previous documentation due to
    the efforts of Tracy Adams, Greg Haverkamp, Philip Greenspun, and Jin
    Choi. It was duly influenced by documents by Sean Yamamoto, David Cohen,
    and Chris Rasch.</para>

    <para>Several improvements were suggested that will be incorporated RSN
    (hold bquinn to it) by Richard Li and Jon Griffin.</para>

    <para>This documentation resulted from the collected efforts of employees at
    ArsDigita and ACS users world-wide. If it is useful, it is because of the
    distributed work of many enabled by the Internet. All mistakes and
    shortcomings are due to the slow typing of Bryan Quinn.</para>
