<title>Linux Requirements</title>

<para>
Red Hat Linux is our preferred Linux distribution.  With <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</ulink>, 
we can get both Oracle and
ACS to work out of the box with no trouble.  However, you can install
the ArsDigita Community System (ACS) to run on any recent version of
Linux.  Here are some of the key requirements that we have identified:

<title>Getting the Red Hat Distribution for the Installation</title>
<para>
You have the following options:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para> Install from CDROM.</para>
      <para>
      You can order an installation CDROM from Red Hat or download an
      ISO image and burn one yourself.  Once you have the CDROM, you
      need to boot the computer.  If you have a recent BIOS and CDROM,
      you should be able to boot directly to the CDROM.  Check your
      system's BIOS to see if this is an option and make sure the
      CDROM is set to boot before the primary hard drive.  Then insert
      the CDROM, boot the computer and Red Hat should start.
      Otherwise, you will need a boot disk.  If you bought a
      commercial Red Hat package, the boot disk is included.
      Otherwise, you can easily create one using one of the standard
      Red Hat images.  Red Hat offers more <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com/download/howto_download.html#download">information</ulink>.

      <listitem><para> Install over the Network.</para>
      <para>
      You can run the Red Hat install over the network if you have a
      fast enough connection.  You'll need to copy roughly 300-600 MB
      of data, so be prepared.  You need to prepare a bootdisk with
      the network image.  Instructions for downloading the image is <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com/download/howto_download.html#download">here</ulink>.
      Read this section of the <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/faqs/rhl_general_faq/FAQ-4.html#ss4.12">Red

<title>Partition Your Drives</title>


<para>
  You need to partition your system;s hard drives before you can
  install the operating system.  Changing your partition table often
  entails wiping out all data on the disk, so be sure to have a backup
  before proceeding.
</para>

<para>
  We specify a minimal partitioning scheme to simplify the
  installation.  If you have a single drive, you should create these
  partitions on /dev/hda (if you have IDE) or /dev/sda (if you have
  SCSI).  If you have multiple drives, you will need to configure your
  system more carefully.  Production Linux servers require careful
  configuration of partitions in order to optimize performance.  See
  this <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Partition.html">HOWTO</ulink>
  for more information.  Our simple configuration for a single large
  (> 3 GB) drive follows.

<sect2 id="install-redhat-boot-device">
<title>Configure Boot Device</title>

<para>

In order to boot your workstation, you either need to install LILO or
have a bootdisk.  The LILO option is recommended.  LILO
(<phrase>LI</phrase>nux<phrase>LO</phrase>ader) writes some data to your hard drive's
master boot record (MBR) which allows the computer to find the
operating system.  It is possible to configure LILO to boot multiple
OSes.  Check the <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/LILO.html"> LILO
documentation</ulink> for more information.  We recommend creating an
emergency boot disk and installing LILO on the master boot record
(MBR) of the first hard drive (usually /dev/hda). Select it and
press enter.
