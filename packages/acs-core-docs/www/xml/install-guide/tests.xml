<title>Acceptance Tests</title>

    <para>By running through the acceptance tests below, you&#39;ll verify that
    your new ACS 4 instance is running nominally, and get acquainted with the
    major administration features of the system.</para>

 

<sect2 id="install-tests-installation">
<title>Installation</title>


    

    <para>You should have followed the <link linkend="acs">steps for installing
    ACS 4</link>; assuming the installation proceeded correctly, your server
    instance should be up and running, and the root URL (http://foo.com/)
    should show a login page asking for your email address and password.
    Proceed to test registration below.</para>
  

    </sect2>

<sect2 id="install-tests-registration">
<title>Registration</title>


    <para>You should test basic registration and the login process. Suggested
    method:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Go to the index page for the Main Site; typically the URL is simply
      yourserver.com/</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Login with a new email address, and walk through registering as a
      new user.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Assuming new accounts are approved immediately, after registration
      you&#39;ll be on the Workspace page for the user, where you can see and
      edit personal data.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Click the &quot;Log out&quot; link on the Workspace page.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Try going back to /pvt/home.tcl again; you&#39;ll be redirected.
      Login as the same user just created.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    

    </sect2>

<sect2 id="install-tests-administration">
<title>User Administration</title>


    <para>You should test adding a user, searching for users, modifying user
    data, banning or deleting a user, and spamming a class of users.
    Suggested method:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Use the email/password combo you created during the installation
      process, and login as an administrator. Go to /acs-admin/users</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Once you&#39;re at /acs-admin/users, click on &quot;Add a
      user.&quot; Create a test user. Return to user administration,
      /acs-admin/users, when done.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Do a quick search for the newly created user, and verify that
      entering part of the test user&#39;s name returns the user.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>View the list of matching users and edit the user data for the new
      test user.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Delete the test user.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Ban the test user.</para></listitem>

<sect2 id="install-tests-packages">
<title>Install and Enable a Package</title>


    <para>The ACS Package Management system (APM) is central to operating your
    ACS server, allowing you to manage ACS Applications and Services.
    Applications are typically user-driven web systems such as Bboard or
    News, while ACS Services are fundamental components such as the Object
    System, Permissions, and the APM itself. Let&#39;s verify the
    functionality of the APM by installing and enabling the Bboard
    application, which your site will almost certainly need.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Logged in as an administrator, go to /acs-admin/apm</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>You&#39;ll see the &quot;ACS Package Manager Administration&quot;
      page; this is where you can view and manage all packages on your
      server. Assuming Bboard is not already installed (make sure you&#39;re
      looking at Package Type: Applications), click on &quot;Load a new
      package from a URL or local directory&quot;</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>You will see the &quot;Load a New Package&quot; page, and a form
      field where you can enter a package URL. In a separate browser window,
      go to the ArsDigita Package Repository, <ulink
      url="http://www.arsdigita.com/acs-repository/">http://www.arsdigita.com/acs-repository/</ulink>, and
      look for ACS 4.x packages. You should see the Bboard package available
      - note the directions in the Help section as to the correct URL to
      enter in the &quot;Load a New Package&quot; page. Enter the URL and
      edit it as needed, and click on &quot;Load.&quot;</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>On the following page, the APM will visit the URL you supplied,
      grab the package file, and extract it on your server&#39;s filesystem.
      There should be a message saying the package is now extracted into your
      filesystem. You should then follow the &quot;install&quot; link at the
      bottom of the page to continue.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>On the &quot;Package Installation&quot; page, you should both
      install and enable the Bboard package - ensure the checkboxes to do so
      are selected , and click on the &quot;Check Dependencies&quot;
      button.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The next page deals with installing the data model for the package;
      you should see one or more SQL files with checkboxes next to each one
      slated for installation. Make sure they&#39;re all checked and click on
      the &quot;Install Packages&quot; button.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>On the final page of installation sequence, you should see
      &quot;Installing Packages,&quot; followed by messages saying the
      package was enabled and installation finished. Restart the server as
      directed.</para></listitem>

<sect2 id="install-tests-sitemap">
<title>Using the Site Map</title>


    <para>One of the most flexible and powerful new features of ACS 4 is the
    Site Map facility that exists for every subsite in the system. The Site
    Map allows you to arbitrarily associate user-visible URLs with packages
    instances, instead of having to change the underlying filesystem
    directory structure. Applications can thus be deployed as an
    administrator sees fit; to have a new bboard instance mapped to
    foo.com/bar/bboard in addition to foo.com/fnord/bboard, she would not
    need shell access to the server, nor need to copy directory trees. For
    the next acceptance test, we&#39;ll &quot;mount&quot; an instance of the
    bboard package under the Main Site (the default subsite).</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Assuming you&#39;ve installed and enabled the bboard package, and
      restarted the server as directed, go to the admin page again,
      /acs-admin/</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>We&#39;ll be working with the default subsite, Main Site, so click
      on the &quot;Main Site Administration&quot; link.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>On the Main Site Administration page, click on the &quot;Site
      Map&quot; link.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>You&#39;ll now see the principal Site Map page; notice how three
      subfolders of the site root &quot;/&quot; are preinstalled:
      &quot;/acs-admin&quot; which you&#39;ve been using thus far,
      &quot;/api-doc&quot; where developers can get detailed information on
      API calls, and &quot;/doc&quot; which is probably where you&#39;re
      reading this Acceptance Test document from.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>To keep things simple, let&#39;s have our bboard instance be mapped
      to a sub-folder of the root &quot;/&quot; level. On the first row which
      starts with &quot;/&quot; click on the &quot;new sub folder&quot;
      link.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>You&#39;ll see a form field asking for the name of the sub folder.
      Type in &quot;test-bboard&quot; and click the &quot;New&quot;
      button.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>You should now see &quot;test-bboard&quot; in the list of URLs for
      the Main Site. Click on the &quot;new application&quot; link in the
      same row to begin creating an instance of the bboard package on
      &quot;test-bboard&quot;</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>You&#39;ll now see a field where the package instance can be named,
      and a drop-down menu of packages. Call the instance &quot;Test
      Bboard&quot; and select bboard from the list of packages, and click
      &quot;New&quot; to continue.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>A Bboard instance is now running on the URL
      &quot;/test-bboard&quot; on your site! To go there, just click on the
      link &quot;Test Bboard&quot; under the Application column on the Site
      Map page, or visit the URL directly in your browser.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>This covers the basics of getting a user-visible application up on ACS
    4 - you can now install and deploy more packages, drop mappings, and
    otherwise configure the functionality and organization of your site as
    you see fit.</para>
